        <h2><strong>Welcome</strong></h2>
        <p>
            This was a love project that was started during our journeys around the United States. What started as just
            a hobbie for me, has become a passion that I hope to share. I have spent time looking for the hidden beauty
            in materials. Relying on the natural beauty that is around us each day to inspire these wristlett designs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: aqua;">
            As we continue to look in to other crafts and project ideas, we hope that you will stay in touch with us for
            future updates.
        </p>
